    "To get students set up quickly, I like to use Replit as they only need an email address, and you don’t have to walk them through a scary install, it has a simpler interface than something like VScode and we can be invited so that we can change the code if they make small syntax errors.\n",

    "Now this first lesson is just going to focus on input/output and variables, hopefully picking up some terms like syntax on the way. I find it’s really important to let students walk into mistakes and have to fix their own mistakes and get used to fixing errors in the console. I also try to make sure each part leads logically onto the next with quite a fast pace, so you can also have students pause and do an extra exercise to improve their understanding.\n"
